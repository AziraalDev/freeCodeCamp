                <header class="artical_subheader">How does the internet work:</header>
                <p>The internet functions as a vast network of interconnected devices using the Internet Protocol (IP)
                    to exchange data. Data is broken into packets, which travel through various routers and switches
                    across the world's infrastructure of cables and wireless connections. These packets find their way
                    to the destination using IP addresses, and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ensures reliable
                    data delivery by establishing connections and managing data flow.</p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">What is HTTP:</header>
                <p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the foundation of data communication on the web.
                    It's a protocol used by web browsers and servers to exchange information, such as web pages, images,
                    videos, and other resources. When you enter a URL in your browser, it sends an HTTP request to the
                    server, which responds with the requested content, allowing you to view web pages and interact with
                    online services.</p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">What is Domain / Domain Name:</header>
                <p>A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify websites on the internet. It provides a
                    more user-friendly way to access websites compared to numeric IP addresses. For example,
                    "example.com" is a domain name. Domains are organized hierarchically, with the top-level domain
                    (TLD) representing the type of entity or the country, followed by second-level and third-level
                    domains.</p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">What is Hosting:</header>
                <p>Hosting refers to the practice of storing website files, databases, and other resources on servers
                    that are connected to the internet. Web hosting companies provide the technology and infrastructure
                    needed to make websites accessible online. When users access a website, their browsers request data
                    from the hosting server, which then delivers the content to be displayed.</p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">DNS and how it works:</header>
                <p>DNS, or Domain Name System, is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses
                    that computers use to identify each other on the internet. When you enter a URL in your browser,
                    your computer queries a DNS server to find the corresponding IP address. This process involves
                    multiple DNS servers, with each step narrowing down the search until the correct IP address is
                    found, allowing your browser to connect to the intended website.</p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">Browsers and how they work:</header>
                <p>Web browsers are software applications that allow users to access and interact with information on
                    the internet. They send HTTP requests to web servers, receive responses, and then render the content
                    as visual web pages. Browsers interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to display text, images, and
                    multimedia content. They also manage cookies, cache data to improve loading times, and provide tools
                    for users to navigate, bookmark, and interact with websites.</p>

                <header class="artical_subheader">HTML Basics:</header>
                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It consists of a
                    series of elements that structure content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML
                    uses tags to define the structure and layout of a webpage, allowing browsers to render the content
                    as intended by the web developer.</p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">Semantic HTML:</header>
                <p>Semantic HTML involves using HTML elements to convey the meaning and structure of the content rather
                    than just its appearance. It improves the accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO) of web
                    pages. Semantic elements like <strong>header, nav, main, article,</strong> and
                    <strong>footer</strong> provide
                    context to both browsers and developers, making the code more readable and aiding in styling and
                    functionality.
                </p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">Forms and Validations:</header>
                <p>HTML forms allow users to input data, such as text, checkboxes, and radio buttons, on a webpage.
                    <strong>form</strong> elements gather this data, and different input types help capture specific
                    information. Form validation ensures that user-submitted data is accurate and properly formatted.
                    HTML5 introduced new
                    input types and attributes, such as email validation and pattern matching, to enhance the user
                    experience and data integrity.
                </p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">Accessibility (a11y):</header>
                <p>Web accessibility refers to designing and developing websites that are usable by people of all
                    abilities, including those with disabilities. Accessible websites use semantic HTML, provide text
                    alternatives for images, offer keyboard navigation, and include descriptive headings. This ensures
                    that everyone, including those using screen readers or assistive technologies, can access and
                    interact with the content.</p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">SEO Basics:</header>
                <p>SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, involves optimizing a website to improve its visibility in search
                    engine results. It includes techniques like using relevant keywords in content, creating descriptive
                    meta tags, optimizing images, improving page load speed, and building high-quality backlinks. Proper
                    HTML structure, semantic markup, and accessible content contribute to better search engine rankings
                    and overall website visibility.</p>

                <header class="artical_subheader">Basics of CSS</header>
                <p>
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the visual presentation of HTML
                    elements on a webpage. It involves defining properties like colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. CSS
                    rules consist of selectors (targeting HTML elements) and declarations (styling instructions)
                    enclosed in curly braces. By linking CSS files to HTML documents, you can separate content and
                    presentation, making websites more organized and maintainable.
                </p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">CSS Positioning</header>
                <p>
                    CSS positioning techniques determine how elements are placed on a webpage. Positioning properties
                    like <code>position</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and
                    <code>left</code> control the placement of elements relative to their containing elements or the
                    viewport. Common values for <code>position</code> are <code>static</code>, <code>relative</code>,
                    <code>absolute</code>, and <code>fixed</code>, each influencing the element's position within the
                    document flow.
                </p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">CSS Flex</header>
                <p>
                    Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS layout model that simplifies the arrangement of elements in a
                    flexible manner. By applying <code>display: flex</code> to a parent container, you can control the
                    distribution, alignment, and order of child elements using properties like
                    <code>flex-direction</code>, <code>justify-content</code>, <code>align-items</code>, and
                    <code>flex-grow</code>.
                </p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">CSS Grid</header>
                <p>
                    CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that enables precise control over rows and columns in a
                    grid format. With the <code>display: grid</code> property applied to a container, you can define
                    both rows and columns using properties like <code>grid-template-rows</code>,
                    <code>grid-template-columns</code>, and place child elements using <code>grid-row</code> and
                    <code>grid-column</code>.
                </p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">Responsive Design</header>
                <p>
                    Responsive design involves creating websites that adapt and look appealing on various devices and
                    screen sizes. It employs CSS techniques like media queries, flexible units (like percentages), and
                    fluid grids to ensure content reflows and adjusts seamlessly across different viewport sizes.
                </p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">Media Queries</header>
                <p>
                    Media queries are CSS rules that apply different styles based on specific conditions, such as screen
                    width, height, orientation, and device characteristics. By using media queries, you can create
                    responsive designs that cater to different devices, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly
                    experience.
                </p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">Pseudo Selectors</header>
                <p>
                    Pseudo-selectors are used in CSS to define styles for specific states or parts of an element that
                    cannot be targeted with a regular class or ID selector. Examples include <code>:hover</code>,
                    <code>:focus</code>, <code>:active</code>, and <code>:nth-child(n)</code>. Pseudo-selectors enhance
                    user interactions and enable advanced styling effects.
                </p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">Intermediate CSS</header>
                <p>
                    Intermediate CSS covers more advanced concepts, like advanced selectors (attribute, sibling, and
                    descendant selectors), CSS variables (custom properties), transitions, and transforms. These
                    concepts allow you to create sophisticated designs and interactive elements.
                </p>
                <header class="artical_subheader">Animations in CSS</header>
                <p>
                    CSS animations involve animating the properties of HTML elements to create movement and visual
                    effects. Using keyframes and the <code>@keyframes</code> rule, you can define how an element changes
                    over a specified duration. CSS animations offer a way to enhance user experience and engage visitors
                    with visually appealing content.

                <p>
                    <strong>npm (Node Package Manager):</strong> npm is a default package manager for Node.js and
                    JavaScript projects. It provides a vast repository of open-source packages that developers can
                    easily integrate into their applications. npm simplifies dependency management, making it a
                    fundamental tool for building Node.js applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>pnpm:</strong> pnpm is a fast and disk-space-efficient package manager for Node.js projects.
                    Unlike npm and yarn, pnpm uses a single global storage for packages and creates hard links, reducing
                    duplication and saving storage space on your machine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>yarn:</strong> Yarn is another popular package manager for JavaScript projects. It was
                    developed by Facebook and offers faster and more reliable package installation compared to npm. Yarn
                    introduced features like parallel installation and a lockfile format that ensures consistent
                    dependency resolution.

                    Choosing a front-end framework is a crucial decision for web developers. Frameworks provide a
                    structured way to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces, but each has its own strengths and
                    considerations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>React:</strong> React, developed by Facebook, is a popular and widely adopted library for
                    building user interfaces. It emphasizes component-based architecture, allowing developers to create
                    reusable UI elements. React's virtual DOM efficiently updates the user interface, making it suitable
                    for building complex and dynamic applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Angular:</strong> Angular, maintained by Google, is a full-fledged framework that provides a
                    comprehensive set of tools for building large-scale applications. It follows the MVC
                    (Model-View-Controller) architecture and offers features like dependency injection, two-way data
                    binding, and a powerful CLI (Command Line Interface).
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Vue:</strong> Vue is a progressive framework that combines the simplicity of libraries like
                    React with the capabilities of larger frameworks like Angular. Developed by a former Google
                    engineer, Vue's core library focuses on the view layer, making it easy to integrate with other
                    projects. Vue's gradual adoption approach appeals to both beginners and experienced developers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Svelte:</strong> Svelte is a unique framework that takes a different approach. Unlike other
                    frameworks that run in the browser, Svelte compiles components into highly efficient JavaScript code
                    during the build process. This results in faster loading times and a smaller runtime footprint.
                    Svelte simplifies complex concepts and offers a smooth developer experience.

                    Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that streamlines the process of building user
                    interfaces. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that provide pre-designed components, Tailwind focuses
                    on providing a set of utility classes that enable rapid development and customization.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With Tailwind, developers can apply styles directly to HTML elements using classes like
                    <code>bg-blue-500</code> for background color or <code>py-4</code> for vertical padding. This
                    approach speeds up development by avoiding the need to write custom CSS for common styling tasks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tailwind's utility classes cover a wide range of design aspects, including layout, typography,
                    spacing, and responsiveness. It encourages a modular approach to design, allowing developers to
                    compose interfaces quickly by combining utilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, Tailwind can be customized to match the project's design system. Developers can modify
                    the default configuration, add new utility classes, and create responsive variants to tailor
                    Tailwind to their specific needs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite initial concerns about HTML bloat, Tailwind's purging process eliminates unused styles in
                    production builds, resulting in optimized and performant code. It offers a balance between rapid
                    development and efficient production.

                    BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a popular CSS architecture that promotes a structured and
                    maintainable approach to styling web applications. It aims to improve collaboration, reduce CSS
                    conflicts, and enhance code readability.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In BEM, styles are organized into <strong>blocks</strong>, which are independent, reusable
                    components. Blocks contain <strong>elements</strong> that are semantically tied to the block and
                    <strong>modifiers</strong> that define variations of the block or element. These three parts form
                    the core of the BEM naming convention.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, a navigation menu could be structured as follows:
                    <code>.nav</code> (block),
                    <code>.nav__item</code> (element),
                    <code>.nav__item--active</code> (modifier).
                </p>

                <p>
                    BEM classes help create clear and self-contained styles. This modular approach minimizes unintended
                    side effects and simplifies the process of maintaining and scaling CSS as the project grows.
                </p>

                <p>
                    BEM's strict naming convention also fosters predictability, making it easier for team members to
                    understand and collaborate on the styling codebase. While BEM is effective, it can lead to longer
                    class names, so it's essential to strike a balance between clarity and brevity.

            <article>
                <p>
                    CSS preprocessors and CSS-in-JS solutions are tools that enhance the development of styles in web
                    applications, offering advanced features and improved workflows.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>SCSS and SASS:</strong> SCSS (Sassy CSS) and SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) are
                    CSS preprocessors that extend CSS with additional features like variables, nesting, and mixins. They
                    make stylesheets more maintainable and efficient by enabling the use of variables for consistent
                    theming, nesting for improved organization, and mixins for reusable style patterns.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>LESS:</strong> LESS is another CSS preprocessor that provides similar features to SCSS and
                    SASS. It simplifies complex tasks like mathematical calculations, color manipulation, and unit
                    conversions. LESS compiles to standard CSS, allowing developers to use its features without
                    impacting browser compatibility.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>CSS-in-JS:</strong> CSS-in-JS is an approach where styles are defined directly in JavaScript
                    code. Libraries like <strong>Styled Components</strong>, <strong>Emotion</strong>, and
                    <strong>JSS</strong> enable developers to write styles as components, keeping the styles
                    encapsulated and scoped to specific components. This approach enhances reusability and mitigates
                    class naming conflicts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While CSS preprocessors and CSS-in-JS have distinct advantages, the choice between them depends on
                    factors like project requirements, team familiarity, and personal preference. Each solution offers
                    unique benefits for managing and maintaining styles in web development.

            <header>SSR</header>
            <article>
                <p>Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique that renders a web page on the server rather than in the
                    browser. When a website's JavaScript is rendered on the website's server, a fully rendered page is
                    sent to the client and the client's JavaScript bundle engages and enables the Single Page
                    Application framework to operate.</p>
                <p>Some advantages of server-side rendering include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Faster load time</strong>. A server-side rendered application speeds up page loading
                        when the user
                        suffers from a slow internet connection. Thus it greatly improves the whole user experience.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Easy indexation by search engines</strong>. As the content can be rendered before the
                        page is loaded when
                        rendering server-side, search engines can easily index and crawl it.</li>
                    <li><strong>There are fewer issues with social media indexing</strong>. Social media crawlers, like
                        search engine
                        bots, have difficulty indexing JavaScript content. Client-side rendering is not supported by
                        Facebook's Open Graph Protocol or Twitter Cards, for example. If social media sharing is an
                        important part of your marketing strategy, server-side rendering may be a better option.</li>
                    <li><strong>Better in terms of accessibility</strong>. SSR apps are better suited for people who use
                        older devices
                        with less powerful CPUs because the server sends pre-rendered content to the browser. Because
                        assistive technologies such as screen readers cannot always parse client-side JavaScript,
                        server-side rendering is frequently recommended for SPA accessibility. So, server-side rendering
                        helps efficiently load web pages for users with slow Internet connections or outdated devices.

                <p><strong>GraphQL</strong> is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs and a query
                    runtime engine.</p>
                <p>GraphQL enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify exactly what data it needs from
                    an API. Instead of multiple endpoints that return separate data, a GraphQL server exposes a single
                    endpoint and responds with precisely the data a client asked for.[2] Because a GraphQL server can
                    fetch from separate data sources and present the data in a unified graph, it isn't tied to any
                    specific database or storage engine.</p>
                <p>GraphQL does not provide a full-fledged graph query language such as SPARQL, or even in dialects of
                    SQL that support transitive closure. For example, a GraphQL interface that reports the parents of an
                    individual cannot return, in a single query, the set of all their ancestors.</p>
