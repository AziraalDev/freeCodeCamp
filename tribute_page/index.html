                    “People," Geralt turned his head, "like to invent monsters and monstrosities. Then they seem less
                    monstrous themselves. When they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal, beat their wives, starve an old
                    woman, when they kill a trapped fox with an axe or riddle the last existing unicorn with arrows,
                    they like to think that the Bane entering cottages at daybreak is more monstrous than they are. They
                    feel better then. They find it easier to live.”
                </p>
